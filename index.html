      <div class="panel-body"><b>About:</b> Winner of Mirum and JWT's Challenge: Can a Computer Hear How You Feel? (YHacks 2017). Founded Flask web application to visualize the varying emotions between two different people having a conversation through interactive graphs, color codes, and probability data. Scores the emotional tone of each speaker in conversation over time based on five core emotions: fear, anger, joy, sadness, and surprise/neutrality. Capable of handling both written messages and voice clips. The user can upload a file containing a conversation, after which this program will split the conversation by speaker and output a graph visualizing the emotions of each speaker throughout the conversation. The user can click "Previous" and "Next" buttons to view specific responses and the numerical probabilities of the emotional content of each response (ex.: The sentence "Heroes and villains both thrive on violence, but we're still categorized" would display Anger with probability 0.2, Surprise/Neutral: 0.05, Fear: 0.13, Sadness: 0.39, and Joy: 0.23). Acceptable file formats are .txt and .wav. <br><br>
      <b>Implementation:</b> Experimented with various sentiment APIs to analyze both written speech and audio clips for two speakers: chose to use Indico, IBM Watson, and Vokaturi APIs for their accuracy and versatility. The back-end framework was built with Flask and Python where we analyzed user input with the respective sentiment API and then organized the data into the necessary format for graphical visualization. For voice clips, we had to use IBM Watson to differentiate between speakers and split the audio clips into segments before analyzing each speaker separately. Front-end framework used Bootstrap/HTML, Javascript, and the Highcharts API to graph emotions throughout a conversation using color changes and probability data.<br><br>
      <b>Background:</b> At YHacks 2017, a 36-hour hackathon held at Yale University, my team and I wanted to build something to analyze emotions in conversation in response to the challenge posed by Mirum and JWT: Can a Computer Hear How You Feel? Since it is easy to misunderstand the emotional state of the team member or customer, our goal was to score and visualize the emotional tone of a conversation so teams can perform better and brands can react accordingly. We hope this application can eventually be used for both business and social purposes, whether to improve the performance of customer service representatives or to help children with autism better understand social cues.<br><br>
      <b>Future</b> (will be implemented soon!):
      <ul> <li>Analyze facial features in combination with written speech and audio files</li>
            <li>Perform live speech analysis in order to be used in real-time</li>
            <li>Support more than two speakers</li>
            <li>Improve UI/UX, including layout, visualization, and color animation</li></ul></div>

      <div class="panel-body"><b>About: </b> Winner of Capital One's Software Engineering Summit Challenge (Fall 2017). Live website viewable at <a href="https://airbnb-host.herokuapp.com/">airbnb-host.herokuapp.com.</a> Created a web application to help new Airbnb hosts in San Francisco figure out how to set the perfect price for their home and capitalize on new trends. The website visualizes public data from Airbnb that contains all the listings in San Francisco with pricing, reviews, and date availability. Includes graphical comparisons of the pricing of listings and number of people accommodated, the most offered amenities by hosts so far, and the most frequently used words in reviews. Also features tools to perform price estimation, bookings optimization, and popularity calculations given a valid geo-location in San Francisco. <br><br>
      <b>Implementation: </b>I used JavaScript, Bootstrap, and PHP to create the website, Airbnb for Hosts, to visualize the data and perform price estimation, bookings optimization, and popularity calculations. I wrote several PHP scripts to process the data given and generate JSON files ready-for-use, so I wouldn't have to do the calculations every time the page loaded. I then used Bootstrap for the layout of the website and JavaScript to do animations, display the data as Google Charts, and process PHP forms and input.<br><br>
      <b>Background: </b>I built this website from scratch in response to Capital One's Coding Challenge: "Hosting Airbnb guests in your home can be an easy way to make extra money. That's especially true in San Francisco, where finding an affordable hotel or hostel can be difficult. But how do new hosts know how to set the perfect price for their home, or what new trends they can capitalize on?" To meet the challenge, I worked to not only satisfy functionality (data visualization, price estimation, bookings optimization) but also present the data in a creative, aesthetic format and organize my code so that it was clear, structured, and readable.<br><br>

      <div class="panel-body"><b>About: </b> Parent-child financial literacy Android mobile application to teach children how to manage their money. Utilizes joint parent-child bank accounts, a task and rewards system, and interactive integration with augmented reality. The parent can add tasks with monetary value for the child to complete (ex.: wash the dishes: $2) and instantly transfer money to the child's account upon completion of the task. The child can then see through the augmented reality part of the app what they can purchase with the money in their account (ex.: green "check" means they can afford it, red "X" means they need to save more). <br><br>
      <b>Implementation: </b>I worked on the backend of the mobile application, coding functions on both the parent and child views of the application to add and complete tasks, create list views, perform account transfers, and save/retrieve data using a database in Firebase. The rest of my team worked on implementing the augmented reality side of the application. <br><br>
      <b>Background: </b>Since children are unfamiliar with banking and money management in general, a few of my friends and I decided to try creating a mobile application to utilize advances in mobile technology to teach financial literacy to children in an interactive way. None of us had any experience with AndroidStudio prior to this project, so we did our best to learn along the way and create this application! Completed in the 24-hour Capital One Software Engineering Summit Hackathon Winter 2018.<br><br>
      <b>Future</b> (will be implemented soon!):
      <ul> <li>Automated system for recurring tasks/rewards</li>
            <li>Integration with existing banking applications, Nessie API</li>

      <div class="panel-body"><b>About:</b> Founded Flask web application to promote destressing and cheerful thinking. Main feature: "Positivity Feed", where users can scroll through en "endless" stream of inspirational quotes, images, cute animal pictures, and other positive content (similar to Facebook Newsfeed). Other features: "About" us page, "Games" page with embedded destressing games, "Exercise" page with embedded YouTube videos and other exercise suggestions, "Food" page with tools to find comfort food at nearby restaurants, "Vent Pillow" page where users can type their thoughts in, and an "Other" page featuring personal favorite ways to de-stress. <br><br>
      <b>Implementation:</b> Constructed front-end of website and embedded content using Bootstrap/HTML and back-end using Flask framework with Python and JavaScript. To implement the continuous scrolling and web scraping needed for the Positivity Feed, used BeautifulSoup to upload image and quote URLs to PyMongo databases, Flask to connect to databases and retrieve data, and AJAX requests to load and format content whenever the user reaches the bottom of the page.<br><br>
      <b>Background:</b> At CalHacks 4.0, my partner and I wanted to create something to help make people happy. As college students, we've noticed a culture of pessimism and low self-esteem that has become prevalent in social media and daily interactions (especially during midterms and finals for students). To address this issue, we built this website to support and motivate people who are feeling stressed or have had a bad day. Though there's still some features we'd like to add, we hope that it cheers up your day!<br><br>
      <b>Future</b> (will be implemented soon!):
      <ul> <li>Survey/check-in: How are you feeling right now? 1 - 10 (Only ask one time per website click)</li>
